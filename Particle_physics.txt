 Particle physics (also known as high energy physics) is a branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter and radiation. Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also theoretical physics). Protons, gas particles, or even household dust, particle physics usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the fundamental interactions necessary to explain their behaviour. In May 2014, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel released its report on particle physics funding priorities for the United States over the next decade. There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from particle cosmology to loop quantum gravity. Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. Many other particle accelerators also exist.
