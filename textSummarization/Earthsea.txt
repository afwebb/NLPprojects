The Earthsea Cycle, also known simply as Earthsea, is a series of high fantasy books written by the American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Following the premiere radio broadcast, each of the episodes were made available for online streaming on BBC Radio 4 Extra for a month, via the BBC iPlayer service. The adaptation was created and aired as part of a thematic month centered on the life and works of Ursula Le Guin, in commemoration of her then-recent 85th birthday. The world of Earthsea is one of sea and islands: a vast archipelago of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. In the early 1990s, Robert Inglis narrated the first three books of the series for Recorded Books. In 2018, all the novels and short stories were published as The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition, with illustrations by Charles Vess. [citation needed] Le Guin has stated that she found the adaptation "disappointing" and "entirely different" from her creation.
