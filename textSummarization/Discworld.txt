Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. Companion publications include eleven short stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference guides. However, a number of novels and stories form novel sequences with distinct story arcs: Rincewind was the first protagonist of Discworld. The Wizards have featured prominently in nine Discworld books as well as starred in The Science of Discworld series and the short story "A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices". There are also humanist themes in many of the Discworld novels, and a focus on critical thinking skills in the Witches and Tiffany Aching series. The books take place roughly in real time and the characters' ages change to reflect the passing of years. Rincewind appeared in eight Discworld novels as well as the four Science of Discworld supplementary books. Most years see the release of a Discworld Diary and Discworld Calendar, both usually following a particular theme.
